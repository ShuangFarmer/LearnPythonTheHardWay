# exercise 2  

# A comment, this is so you can read your program later.  
# Anything after the # is ignored by python.  

print "I could have code like this." # and the comment after is ignored  

# you can also use a comment to "disable" or comment out a piece of code:  
# print "This won't run."  

print "This will run."   

# A good way of checking your codes  
# review each line going backward.  
# in this way, your brain is kind of fed on new pieces of information and can easily spot bugs.
